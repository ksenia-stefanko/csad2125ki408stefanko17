Repository Details
This repository is dedicated to the course Automated Design of Computer 
Systems, specifically for the first laboratory work. A new branch, 
feature/develop/task1, has been created where I updated the README file 
according to the requirements and committed the changes.

Task Details
The root folder should contain the following directories as needed:

3party - for all third-party tools;
lib - for libraries;
build - for generated code and binaries;
ci - for continuous integration scripts;
media - for images and videos;
config - for configuration files.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is the most common design 
approach; however, students may opt for an alternative approach, provided 
they have strong arguments for the pros and cons of their chosen method.

The following elements must be included:
Patterns;
Data-Driven Approach.

Technologies, Programming Languages, and Hardware
In this project, I will utilize the following technologies and programming 
languages:

Programming Language: Python, due to its simplicity and flexibility in 
handling game logic.
Framework: Pygame for creating the game interface and handling user 
interactions.
Version Control: Git for source code management and collaboration.
Development Environment: Visual Studio Code as the IDE for coding.
